#summary Installation how-to

= Introduction =

This page explains how to install Piaf GUI, library and plugins in Linux or MacOS X

= Requirements =

== Linux ==

You need to install OpenCV and Qt4.

The script `./prepare.sh` in root directory install required packages for Debian/Ubuntu using `apt-get`.
{{{
sudo ./prepare.sh
}}}

But maybe you want to install manually or on another kind of package manager.

=== Qt4 ===

Easiest way is to use the packages from your distribution. You can download latest version here : http://qt.nokia.com

=== OpenCV ===

You need _libcv_, _libcvaux_ and _libhighgui_. You have got 2 solutions:
  # Use your distribution packages : install a development version of OpenCV with your package manager, for example:
{{{
apt-get install libcv-dev libcvaux-dev libhighgui-dev
}}}
  # Download and install from snapshot or SVN : http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/

You may need to download and install FFMPEG to use _highgui_.

== MacOS X ==

Easiest way is to :
  * install Qt from DMG : http://qt.nokia.com
  * OpenCV from sources : http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/


= Compilation =

You need to compile first the library in order to use plugins. Without plugins, Piaf is just an poor image viewer and video player.

== First: Plugin's library ==

Go to main/ and compile using `piaf-lib.pro`
